## TL;DR

During bugbounties, penetrations tests, red teamings and other great activities there is always a room , when you need to launch amass, subfinder, sublister or any other tool to find subdomains that you can use to break through - like test.google.com, dev.admin.paypal.com or staging.ceo.twitter.com.
Withing this repository you will be able find out the answers for the next questions:

1. What are the most popular subdomains?
2. What are the most common words used in multilevel subdomains on different levels?
3. What are the most used words in subdomains?


And, like with the passwords -  masks, lenghts and character distributions!  

And of course WORDLISTS


Methodology

If subdomains appears more than in 5-10 **different** scopes it will be put in the list. That's all -  nothing more, nothing less.
