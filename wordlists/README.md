# Popular subdomains

In this lists you will find most popular subdomains **as is**.

| Name | Count  | Frequency(\*) |
|---|---|---|
| Top 100 | 100 | >20  |
| Top 100 | 200 | 10-20  |
| Top 100 | 300 | 3-10  |


## Performance

I pick up few random bugbounty scopes and tried to launch subdomain discovery with dnsx against all of them with several popular wordlists. 

| Wordlist | Words count  | Time  | Number of subdomains |
|---|---|---|---|
| subfinder | 100 | >20  | >20  |
| another one | 200 | 10-20  | >20  |
| Tiny | 300 | 3-10  | >20  |
| Medium | 300 | 3-10  | >20  |
| Hige | 300 | 3-10  | >20  |

# Subdomain levels

In this lists you will find most popular splitted words from subdomains splitted by levels. F.E - **dev.stg** subdomain will be splitted in two words **dev** and **stg**. **dev** will have level = 2, **stg** - level = 1. All worlists have frequency(\*) >= 5. You can use these wordlists for combinatory attack for subdomain search.




| Name | Count  |
|---|---|
| Level 1 | 100 |
| Level 2 | 200 |
| Level 3 | 300 |
| Level 4 | 300 |

Frequency - how often this subdomains appears in different scopes. For example, if **dev.stg** appears both in \*.google.com and \*.twitter.com, it will have frequency will be 2. It does **not matter** how often **dev.stg** appears in \*.google.com.
